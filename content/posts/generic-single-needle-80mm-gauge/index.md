The gauge is designed as a series of parallel 3D printed plastic “decks”, separated by standard PCB standoffs. It's compatible with a typical 3 1/8 inch panel cutouts.

Controller and interface board is the last deck. Like every gauge in CANSim, It’s based on Arduino Nano and provides [RJ45-based CAN interface]({{< ref "/can-rj45-pinout" >}}). All gauges communicate with a master controller which in turn has USB connection to a host PC with a simulator (or to a networked PC).

## Assembly

* Insert glass (1) into front bezel (2). Optionally glue (normally not required for home use). Front bezel is ready.
* Glue the face paper (4) into its deck using PVA or similar glue.
* Mount the motor (7) into its deck (6) using two M2x20 screws.
* Stack the face deck and the motor desk using 4 standoffs (8). Attach the arrow (3) to the motor.
* Place the front bezel on the top of the assembly and fix with four M3 screws (9).
* Attach PCB and fix with M3 nuts (10).
* Mount on the panel using cutouts.

## Front Bezel

A front bezel design is shared by most of CANSim instruments. It contains the plate itself and a glass.
A bezel is typically 3D printed from ABS.

A circular glass (74mm diameter) can be cut from 2mm transparent acrylic plate. 1.5mm or 3mm will work as well

## Firmware and I/O

Generic gauge is receive-only instrument, it can receive a single float value as a gauge position.

| Port | Data Type | Description           |
|------|-----------|-----------------------|
| 0    | FLOAT     | Arrow Position 0..MAX |
