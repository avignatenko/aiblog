## Approach

I already had Gydrolock motorized valves installed and working through a proprtietary controller unit. With my board the intention is to bring the following under home automation:
* open/close of water valves, both cold and hot
* emergency water leak alarm (via sensor installed with gydrolock)
* water meter pulse counter 
* air temperature and humidity inside the water block
